# Security policy

Volc Agent Launchpad is a hackathon proof of concept. Only the latest revision
on the default branch is supported.

## Report a vulnerability

Send the repository owner or event organizer the affected revision,
reproduction steps, impact, and suggested mitigation. Do not publish
credentials, personal data, or exploit details in an issue.

## Known limitations

- Shared demo token; no user identity, authorization, RBAC, or tenant isolation
- No CSRF protection
- No per-Agent container boundary in ECS mode
- Ordinary local containers, not hardened multi-tenant sandboxes
- Broad outbound network access
- Prompt-triggered command and file execution
- Ark key always available to the server process. In `local-process` mode (the
  default) it is also in the Codex child environment; in `container` mode the
  Runtime container receives only a short-lived, single-run proxy token
- Credential proxy at `/ark-proxy` authenticates with run tokens, not
  `APP_AUTH_TOKEN`; a token captured while its run is active can spend Ark quota
- Proxy forwards any path under `ARK_BASE_URL`, not just the model endpoint
- Ark key stored in Terraform POC state

## Safe use

- Use a dedicated development machine or disposable ECS instance.
- Use a scoped, revocable Ark key and a unique `APP_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Keep local use on loopback and restrict ECS Web and SSH CIDRs.
- Add HTTPS before sending the shared token over an untrusted network.
- Never mount production data or provide Volcengine account AK/SK to Agents.
- Stop the POC, destroy test resources, and revoke keys after the event.

Codex uses `workspace-write` when Landlock is available. On unsupported kernels,
startup warns and relies on the outer Docker or rootless Podman boundary. This
fallback is not tenant isolation.
